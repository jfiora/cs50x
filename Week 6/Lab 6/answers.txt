Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

Almost anyone. Belgium, brazil and portugal always leaded the podium


Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

After a couple simulations the results starts being the same
